Needed:
  - Coomb filter (forward- and backward feedback)
  - Implement missing biquad standard types
  - Type converters (8 <-> 16 <-> 32)

Nice2have:
  - AGC component

Later:
  - Specialized PCM writer than can handle endianness
  - put data on the network in network-byte-order, and read this way then convert to system-endianness
