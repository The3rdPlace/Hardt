Needed:
  - Decimator
  - Upconverter
  - Encoder base (cw, rtty etc. needs this.. Use HFilter as example)

Nice2have:
  - cw encode
  - allow HWindow to be applied only the beginning or end of a block

Later:
  - Specialized PCM writer than can handle endianness
  - put data on the network in network-byte-order, and read this way then convert to system-endianness
